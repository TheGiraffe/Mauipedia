# Mauipedia
For Maui locals, to paint a picture of what Maui is now and what it was before. A time capsule, a repository, of local businesses and organizations still here and long gone, of what things used to look like, and of things dear to the hearts of the people of this island and of all generations.

# How to contribute to Mauipedia
Mahalo for wanting to help grow Mauipedia! If you would like to create new pages or update the information on pages, our preference is that you are from Maui or have ties to the island. However, anyone is welcome to recommend new pages or updates to pages using the ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-update%20mauipedia%20page-%23b2f9a2) issue label and ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-new%20mauipedia%20page-%23bfdadc) issue label! 

(For example, if you visited Maui recently and found a great shave ice shop that isn't on Mauipedia yet, you can totally open a ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-new%20mauipedia%20page-%23bfdadc) issue and recommend us to add it!)

For contributors from Maui, even if you are planning on creating or updating the page yourself and not just suggesting, it is still preferred that you open an issue first for new pages or page updates so that everyone knows that you're working on it rather than just submitting a pull request with your edits. This is also best practice such that it opens up a communication channel between you, the admins, and other collaborators to confirm that nobody else is working on the same thing, that the page idea is likely to be accepted into the wiki, and thus that your efforts will be fruitful.

Other wonderful ways to support this project include tweeting about it, liking us on Facebook, and considering making a donation to help us continue to run this project. Mahalo nui loa for your support! ðŸŒº 
_(Action point to sophia to create a twitter and facebook sometime soon, as well as a platform for donations)_

## Updating a page: 

Please open an issue labelled ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-update%20mauipedia%20page-%23b2f9a2) under the "Issues" section of the Mauipedia repository that states what new page you'd like to create so that we know that you're updating page. Include the name of the page you are updating in the issue title.

Once given the go-ahead by the admins (best practice, to help ensure your contribution will be accepted):

Make sure to fork the main Mauipedia repository, clone the fork to your computer, then open the page's HTML file and add your updates. Then add, commit, and push it to your forked repository. (Note: If you've contributed to Mauipedia in the past and already have a forked repository, then make sure to [sync it](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) with the upstream Mauipedia repository).

Make a pull request comparing your forked repository to the main Mauipedia repo:

If there are no merge conflicts, then submit the pull request and we will get back to you about it soon! We will let you know if there are any problems and offer suggestions, or we will accept it and it will be live on Mauipedia!
